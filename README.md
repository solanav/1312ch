# 1312ch
This engine is still under construction. It also is my first project using Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView so don't expect high quality code for now.

Once the engine is in a more usable state and I learn to deploy phoenix applications this project will go live on http://1312ch.com

# Instructions to start the server
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
