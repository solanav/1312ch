# 1312ch
This engine is still under construction. It also is my first project using Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView so don't expect high quality code.

Once the engine is in a more usable state and I learn to deploy phoenix applications this project will go live on https://1312ch.com

# Instructions to start the server
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
